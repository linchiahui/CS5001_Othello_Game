--Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart?

No, I just set the computer random choose the valid move in my valid_move_list.
I think it is enough to beat me, because I'm not good at play Othello.

--If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?

No, I do not attempt to make com smarter

--How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm

My com is just random choose one move in the valid_move_list.
After success place a disc on board, my code would recount the valid move and save to a list.

--How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?

My computer beat me 3 out of 5 games

--How would you improve it in the future?

If I hope to improve my com, I will try to count the most count of flip move that computer can place in valid move list.
